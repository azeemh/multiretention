How to Use:

$ cd path/to/retentionreport
$ php -S localhost:8000

Returns a Retention Report across multiple API users given a product Id.

Enter a username, password, and product id for each offer you want to track and you will see a collapsible breakdown per publishing  affiliate, per sub-affiliate id. Each Product will have it's own Total Row. 

Furthermore it's built with future extensibility in mind, allowing for HTML table functions by viewing the source, allowing calculations per set of offers etc on a dynamically created table, - or more simply by summing all the values in a column etc. 

Addtional JQuery features such as table sorting and CSV and Excel export to come.
